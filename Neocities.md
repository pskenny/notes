It new [GeoCities](https://geocities.restorativland.org/). Personal, static web hosting for free everyone!

It has a strong community including alternative, 00's, experimental, manga style websites. There are lot are dead websites, but there are many wonderfully interesting and personal too. Many are made by one, not committee, with odd results.

They've a lot of open-source repositories on GitHub: [check out the Neocities GitHub profile here](https://github.com/neocities) - *spoiler: the backend is written in [[JavaScript]].*

I think they're worth supporting. There's a [$5 per month tier](https://neocities.org/supporter) that's not the worst.
