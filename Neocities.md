New [GeoCities](https://geocities.restorativland.org/). Personal, static web hosting for free everyone!

Has a strong community of alternative, 00's, experimental, manga style websites. A lot are dead, but there are many wonderfully interesting personal websites too. Many are made by one, not committee, with odd results.

They've a lot of open-source repositories on GitHub: [Neocities Â· GitHub](https://github.com/neocities) - *spoiler: the backend is written in [JavaScript](JavaScript.md).*

I think they're worth supporting. There's a [$5 per month tier](https://neocities.org/supporter) that's not the worst.
