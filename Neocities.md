It new [GeoCities](https://geocities.restorativland.org/). Personal web hosting for free and for everyone!

It has a strong community including, but not limited to, alternative, 00's, experimental, manga style websites. [Check them out!](https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=special_sauce) There are lot are dead websites, but there are many wonderfully interesting and personal ones too. Many are made by one, not committee, with odd results.

They've a lot of open-source repositories on GitHub: [check out the Neocities GitHub profile here](https://github.com/neocities) - *spoiler: the backend is written in [[JavaScript]].*

I think they're worth supporting and I pay them for the service. There's a [$5 per month tier](https://neocities.org/supporter) that's not the worst.
