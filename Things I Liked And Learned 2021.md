_Inspired by [Fogus](http://blog.fogus.me/)' "The best things and stuffâ€¦"_

## Podcasts

- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) - Smart people having long conversations with Lex. Spoken with empathy and a generous understanding. Although long (usually 2.5/3 hours), I've never regretted listening to a minute.
- [CoRecursive Podcast](CoRecursive Podcast.md) - Interviews with tech people, programmer oriented. Consistently interesting.

Also see [Podcasts I Like](Podcasts I Like.md).

## Films/TV Shows/YouTube

- [The Midnight Gospel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11639414/) - Gentle existential conversations with bright, playful and reflective visuals.
- [Patrick (H) Willems](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1fG3gT44nGTPU2sVLoFWg) - Someone who loves and knows a lot about film making talks about films.
- [The Minute Hour - Something Terribly Offensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkDOuRAwrYE)

## Books

- [Can't Hurt Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me) - David Goggins has an mindset of overcoming everything and doing what most would think impossible. A pretty punchy read, it's framed by his challenges to reveal his mindset.
