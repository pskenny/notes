Great magazine and blog about low-tech solutions. A better description than I can do can be found over at [Damaged Earth Catalog](https://damaged.bleu255.com/Low-Tech/).

Their website runs on solar powered batteries so occasionally it's not available for a time. I think it's set up in Barcelona, Spain.
