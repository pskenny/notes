Great magazine and blog about low-tech explorations, ideas and solutions. A better description than I can do can be found over at [Damaged Earth Catalog](https://damaged.bleu255.com/Low-Tech/).

Their website runs on solar powered batteries so occasionally it's not available for a time. I think it's set up in Barcelona, Spain.

Some things by them I like include:

- [Can We Make Bicycles Sustainable Again?](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/02/can-we-make-bicycles-sustainable-again/)
- [How to Build a Small Solar Power System](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/12/how-to-build-a-small-solar-power-system/)
- [The Revenge of the Hot Water Bottle](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle/)
- [Reinventing the Greenhouse](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/12/reinventing-the-greenhouse/)
