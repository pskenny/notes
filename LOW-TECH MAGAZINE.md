Link: [LOW‚ÜêTECH MAGAZINE](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/)

Great magazine and blog about low-tech solutions. A better description than I can do can be found over at [Damaged Earth Catalog](https://damaged.bleu255.com/Low-Tech/)

The website runs on solar powered batteries so sometimes it's down. I think it's set up in Barcelona, Spain?
