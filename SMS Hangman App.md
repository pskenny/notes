description: Idea for a hangman game every time you get a text message.

**SMS messaging app idea**: When you get a text it's received as a game of [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) to solve. If you don't succeed, the text message is deleted. Good luck trying to guess activation/verification codes.

Would like to try doing it using [[Kotlin]] and [Jetpack Compose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpack_Compose).
