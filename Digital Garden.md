description: What is a digital garden and I show you mine
digitalGarden: Bud

A Digital Garden is a computer-y cultivated space for personal knowledge. Adding, editing, removing, and restructuring informal (sometimes *very* loose) information. Emphasise the connections between things. Rinse and repeat. You can do it without touching any code too. It can be totally private. Mine is a mostly private space for private learning in public.

Lots of things that are the most important for my life are left out of the digital garden. It's mostly a memory and learning tool to me. For example, I don't need or really use it for the topic of [[Java]], the programming language I've 10+ years experience with and am employed to write. I don't *need* additional scaffolding around my thoughts to remember and organise them. I've already internalised a lot. I can learn new things about it quickly, remember them well enough, move on, repeat. In this way this digital garden is lopsided to things I don't really know about, have a passing thought/interest of or find difficult to keep track and learn. It is incorrect. That's is no different to in my brain, but when it's written down it's more structured, easily reviewed, transmitted to others, and corrected.

I've three categories:

- **Seed** - new, small, not built upon.
- **Bud** - rough, a bit more expanded upon and effort expended.
- **Evergreen** - all good, nothing more needed or it's been expanded upon enough. Also see [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX).
