A Digital Garden is a computer-y cultivated space for knowledge. Adding, editing, removing, and restructuring informal (sometimes *very* loose) information. Emphasise the connections between things. Rinse and repeat. You can do it without touching any code too. It can be totally private. Mine is mostly private.

You can read more about the ideas in some of these places:
