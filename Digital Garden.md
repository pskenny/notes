A Digital Garden is a computer-y cultivated space for knowledge. Adding, editing, removing, and restructuring informal (sometimes *very* loose) information. Emphasise the connections between things. Rinse and repeat. You can do it without touching any code too. It can be totally private. Mine is mostly private.

I've three categories:

- **Seed** - new, small, not built upon.
- **Bud** - rough, a bit more expanded upon and effort expended.
- **Evergreen** - all good, nothing more needed or it's been expanded upon enough.
