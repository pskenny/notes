- Use browser extension Web Archives for dead websites.
- Have RSS reader configured and ready to go. I like [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/).
- Don't muddy your email inbox with newsletters. Use [Kill The Newsletter](https://ktnrs.com/) to turn email subscriptions into RSS feeds (I found out about it [here](https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/kill-the-newsletter/)).
- If you use [Obsidian](Obsidian.md), check out their [Obsidian Web Clipper Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-clipper-obsidian/).
