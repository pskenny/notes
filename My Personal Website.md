I've turned my private half-assed PKMS into a public no-assed digital garden.

It's a [Haskell](Haskell.md) program written using [Hakyll](Hakyll.md) that builds the website when executed. I have scripts to load in files and graph data from my [[PKMS]].

The steps are:

- Get public marked files using [PKSPKMS](PKSPKMS.md)
- Sanitise frontmatter
- Export them using PKSPKMS to get rid of nonstandard Markdown (Wikilinks, Dataview queries, etc)
- Build and run program
- Check for dead links using Lychee

Hosted on [Neocities](Neocities.md).

The design is heavily copying the look of [Obsidian](Obsidian.md). I'd like to add more graph traversal features in the future though.
