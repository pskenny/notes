I've turned my private, half-assed [PKMS](PKMS.html) into a public, no-assed [digital garden](Digital Garden.html) that's hosted on [Neocities](Neocities.html). A [[Python]] script exports my notes using [PKSPKMS](PKSPKMS.html), then uses [Pandoc](Pandoc.html) to turn those [[Markdown]] notes into [[HTML]]. It also uses [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) for search and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for displaying the graphs. It's a very long and effortful way to make your own [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) alternative. I thought it'd be fun. It turned out to be an extremely long way to have fun.
