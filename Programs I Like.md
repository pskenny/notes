## Other

Programs/apps that are cool but don't use often but are worth mentioning:

- [OpenFoodFacts](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood/) App - Look up food ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts
	- Relies on [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover), a public and open database for food products. Open databases are **great**.
	- If what you scanned isn't available, it provides a very easy and quick way to add it to the database thereby improving the data for everyone. Also good for updating out of date facts.
	- I live in Ireland and it worked surprisingly well for products here. Anything that wasn't there I could add easy and quickly.
- [MakeACopy](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.schliweb.makeacopy/) - privacy focused document/text scanner
