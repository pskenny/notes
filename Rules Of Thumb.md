- If you can't buy it twice, you can't afford it.
- Having €1,000 isn't a lot, but owing €1,000 is a lot.
- Reducing the amount of time to start a task to less than 20 seconds is important to doing it often.
- A little a lot is better than a lot a little.
- If you can't do it the right way then that leaves only one other option (related: first make it, then make it good)
- People remember how you make them feel a lot more than the things you've said.
- Buy secondhand when you can. How many knives and forks are out there unloved and why buy a new one?
- Be generous in understanding when explaining things. Everyone meets new information when they do, not when it's created and/or from. Expand out from conversation and context.
- Money is a means, not an end
	- If you are struggling don't worry about the following, but if you have enough, have a to-the-euro amount of how much money is enough (hint: it's your **required** expenditure per month, not more). Remember that number and then remember that other's number is less.
