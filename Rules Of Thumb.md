- If you can't buy it twice, you can't afford it.
- Having €1,000 isn't a lot, but owing €1,000 is a lot.
- Reducing the amount of time to start a task to less than 20 seconds is important to doing it often.
- A little a lot is better than a lot a little.
- If you can't do it the right way then that leaves only one other option (related: first make it, then make it good)
- People remember how you make them feel a lot more than the things you've said.
- Buy secondhand when you can. How many knives and forks are out there unloved and why buy a new one?
- Act as though any knowledge you think as special as normal and be generous in understanding when explaining it. Everyone meets new information when they do, not when it's created and/or from. Expand out from conversation and context.
