Obsidian's a local Markdown editor with a really nice WYSIWYG. It runs on mobile and desktop.

It's my favourite notes editor at the moment.

It also has a plugin system for extending is capabilities. This can be seen used to great effect on the [Obsidian subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD).

Currently, I have my notes locally synced between my devices with [[Syncthing]]. Conflicts do occur sometimes but they're easily resolved. Most conflicts can be avoided by closing Obsidian in your previous device before using it in the next.

Some plugins I use:

- Dataview
- Linter
- Auto note mover
- Homepage
- Tasks
- Templater
- Media DB
- Advanced Tables
- Auto link title
- Improved random note
