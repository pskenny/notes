Obsidian is a local [[Markdown]] editor (really more a Markdown + HTML viewer/editor) with a really nice [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). It runs on mobile and desktop.

It's my favourite notes editor at the moment and I have [[Thoughts on Obsidian MD|other thoughts on it]].

It also has a plugin system for extending is capabilities. This can be seen being used to great effect on the [Obsidian subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD).

To see other peoples vaults (collection of notes in Obsidian) you can find some on [awesome-vaults](https://github.com/conneroisu/awesome-vaults).
